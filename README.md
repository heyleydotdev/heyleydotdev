ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Raveen, a full-stack web developer from Sri Lanka passionate about JavaScript and TypeScript.

I started an eSports clan called Pandora eSports in 2k17, focused on Call of Duty 4, and began hosting and selling servers in 2k18. Since then, I've been hosting game servers [Call of Duty 4, Minecraft, SA-MP], web development, hosting and maintenance. I'm still maintaining [Call of Duty 4 server](https://www.pndes.win/), [Teamspeak server](https://www.pndes.win/), and the [website](https://www.pndes.win/). Check it out if you're interested.
